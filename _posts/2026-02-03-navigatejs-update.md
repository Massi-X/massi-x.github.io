Following my original [post from 2023](/2023/10/05/navigatejs.html) something big happened to the browser scene: the Navigate JS API finally landed on all the modern browsers!

As previously said this API enables incredible capabilities for web developers, infact every navigation related event can be manipulated at your wish to generate beautiful cross-page animations, dynamically load new content, make decisions based on previous navigation...

I must admit that apart from the infinite list of Google defects, Chromium (which really is Chrome and other Chromium based browsers) is still the go-to way if you plan to test new web APIs, other browsers usually follow with caution.

Here's the [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigation#browser_compatibility){:target="_blank"} Mozilla MDN if you wanna check full browser compatibility. Nice coding to all!
